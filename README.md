# Berisso Tourism Showcase
## What is it? 
It's a website with an interactive basketball scoreboard, where you can add points to each team and restart the game if needed. 
It's also the third project, and the second solo project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 3, where they teach you JavaScript.
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a custom font
## What did I learn?
 ### Things explained but that I already knew
  - ** Javascript variables: ** declaration and initialization of variables with `let`
  - ** Functions: ** How to write and use them.
  - ** DOM: **How to modify or add functionalities to HTML elements using their id's.
    - `document.getElementById()` `element.textContent`
  - ** Addition assignment (+=): ** to sum the same variable with another value and assign the new value to the same variable.
### Why is the website too simple if I know how to make it better?
I want to only use the things that I learned in the Scrimba course before doing the project, and after I complete the course, return to the projects individually and improve them with all the things necessary for a correct website. I don't want to modify the website too much; and make it difficult to improve or fix after.
